This repository contains the project materials for all 7 weekly projects for DSI-ATX-1

Please clone this repository to your computer and inspect the structure. Each folder corresponds to one of the weekly projects, and contains the project prompt (readme.md), rubric, starter code, and dataset. Note that starter code is provided as is, and you will probably need to make minor tweaks like changing the path to the data set to get it running properly. You do not have to use the starter code that is provided, it's simply a framework for your submission. As long as you clearly delineate where each question is being answered, we will accept your submission. 

Each Friday morning, you will submit your project materials as follows:

1. Navigate to the project folder for that week.

2. Add/modify the "assets" folder to contain all the data that your project submission materials rely on. For example, if you are submitting a regular Tableau workbook (NOT .twbx), then place the data corresponding to that workbook in the "assets" folder, and make sure that the Tableau workbook opens properly. You may also submit a packaged Tableau workbook (.twbx) which bundles the data in with the visualizations so that this isn't required.

3. Create a new folder caled "submission" and place your project materials (Jupyter notebooks, Tableau workbooks, graphics/visualizations, anything other than raw data) in this folder. These materials must only reference data in the "assets" folder.

4. Commit, then sync your repository with the classroom's. 

If you do not follow these instructions, we will ask you to resubmit, and we will not give you feedback on the project until you submit properly.
