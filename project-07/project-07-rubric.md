Data Science Immersive | Project 7						

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, [derived from the data science workflow](../../../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf):

- [ ] Identify Problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data		
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Results
- [ ] *Professional Development*

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Problem Statement + Goals | | | |x|
| Acquire: Create Postgres database + Join tables  | | |x| n/a |
| Parse: Query Data + Describe Risks/Assumptions  | | | |x|
| Parse: Plot & Describe data  | | |x| *Bonus: Include 3-dimensional graph* |
| Mine: Format & Clean data | | |x| n/a |
| Refine: Define distribution & correlations | | |x| n/a |
| Model: Conduct PCA  | | |x| n/a |
| Present: Create formal report: problem, findings, in-depth example, recommendations | | | |x|
| *Bonus! Present: Create blog post summary* | | | | |
| *Bonus! Deploy: Push final dataset & model to AWS* | | | | |

- **Section Sub-Score**: 19 out of 19 points possible.
- Notes:
Good use of the normal test statistic. Would have been good to write a sentence saying that the p-values are very low and we can therefore reject the null hypothesis and the data is NOT normally distributed according to that statistic. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html

However, the question does imply that it should be distributed normally, and it should have been worded differently.

## PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
> Instructors: This category should only be used mid-way through the course as a means of assessing student personal and professional conduct, including adherence to the GA Code of Conduct, participation in outcomes, and general class conduct.

Demonstrate the ability to successfully communicate and collaborate with others in the classroom and within teams. Treat your peers, teammates, & instructors with respect. You make and follow agreements, and maintain a growth mindset.

#### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Do you effectively communicate your work, progress, availability and expectations to your instructor, classmates and/or teammates? | | | | |
| Are you meeting all required deadlines for your deliverables? | | | | |
| Do you organize your project materials in a structured, easily navigable manner? | | | | |
| Do you respond well to constructive feedback? Are you implementing suggested improvements? | | | | |
| *Optional*: Are you resolving conflict in a professional and respectful manner? | | | | |
